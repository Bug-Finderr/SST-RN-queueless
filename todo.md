# Full-Stack React Native

You are required to **pick ONE problem statement** from the list below and **build a complete working application** using everything you’ve learned so far in **React Native + Backend development**.

> You must pick **only ONE** problem statement.
> Multiple submissions will not be considered.

This assignment is designed to test:

* real-world problem understanding
* frontend + backend integration
* API design and data modeling
* clean code and system thinking

## General Rules (Read Carefully)

* This is an **individual assignment**
* You **may use AI**, but:

  * Blind copy-paste will be penalized
  * You must understand and explain your code
* Plagiarism checks will be done
* Each project must have:

  * A working **mobile app**
  * A working **backend**
  * Proper **README**

---

## Mandatory Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* React Native (Expo)
* Navigation (Stack / Tabs)
* State Management (Context / Redux Toolkit)
